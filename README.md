openborg
========
An opensource implementation of Google Borg using Apache ZooKeeper and docker.

It aims to manage infrastructure in multiple datacentres providing developers the choice 
of deploying clusters of applications on either bare metal with docker and virtualized. 
The clusters of applications then communicate with ZooKeeper to announce their locations. 
Possibly in the future updating load balancers or DNS. 

It aims to deploy, monitor and scale applications on a choice of infrastructure.


Could use buildpacks.
